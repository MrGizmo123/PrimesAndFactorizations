# PrimesAndFactorizations
List of all primes less than 1 million, and list of prime factorizations of all natural numbers less than 1 million. The factorizations are split into two files because of github's upload limit, first contains 500000 entries, second contains 499999 entries

## Formatting

All the entries are separated by newlines

### Primes
For Example
$$ 163 $$
This is the 37th prime, it is written as
`i: 37 , p: 163`

### Factorizations
For Example
$$ 504 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^1 $$
This would be written as 
`{504 ,[{2 ,3}, {3 ,2}, {7 ,1}]}`
